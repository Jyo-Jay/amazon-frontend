      commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Amazon strives to be Earth’s most customer-centric company,
      Earth’s best employer, and Earth’s safest place to work. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations,
        Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Career Choice, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, Alexa,
